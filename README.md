# About me 
My name is Tracy, I live in Alberta Canada and I recently graduated from the University of British Columbia. I am excited to begin my GIST degree with the open source GIS class at UofA. Some of my favorite things are skiing, rodeos, and fishing, and I would like to use my GIS skills to advance research in the natural resource sector here up north.
